# Adobe Creative Cloud ExtendScript Document Object Models

This repository contains the interfaces for all of the Document Object models for Adobe Creative Cloud Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, as well as ScriptUI and the base JavaScript class. I don't know which version these interfaces are from. They are at least a few years old but I have not run into any issues with deprecated features. The one big caveat is that in Photoshop, CEP is deprecated in favor of UXP.

I can't guarantee that these interfaces are 100% accurate but I have found them to be immensely useful. I am happy to give credit where it is due. I found these on a public repository for a university but I don't recall where. Ultimately I am fairly certain these files came from Adobe and are open source.
